# Facebook Group Scrape
Code for collecting data on any public Facebook group.

## Quick Start: Doing a test run from docker

    docker pull mchirico/facebook-group-scrape


Create a tmp dir

    mkdir -p tmp


Once the image is downloaded, run it.

	docker run -it -v `pwd`/tmp:/tmp/data mchirico/facebook-group-scrape /bin/sh -c 'cd src && ./mainRun.sh'
	
	2016-05-28
	2016-06-04
	2016-06-11
	2016-06-18
	2016-06-25
    ...
	
The command above creates the file database.sqlite. You can copy this file out
after you get the container id from the "docker ps -a" command. Note below my
id was 11b4f36b58a0. Obviously your id will be something different.

    docker ps -a
	
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED             
	11b4f36b58a0        mchirico/facebook-group-scrape   "/bin/sh -c 'cd src &"   About a minute ago  

    # Now bring the database.sqlite file to your host
	# My id was 11b4f36b58a0. Yours will be different
	
    docker cp 11b4f36b58a0:/src/data/database.sqlite .

At this point you should have data from 2016-05-28 from the Facebook Group "Unofficial Cheltenham Township",
Facebook group id 25160801076.  You can put your own group id in **tokenf.py**

	cat tokenf.py
	
	TOKEN='173263836xx..D4'  # <--- This token may have expired. Replace with your own.
	...
    FACEBOOK_GROUP='25160801076'  # <----- Set to the group you want.


Note. You shoud set your own TOKEN. It's likely that after 90 days the TOKEN in this
docker file will have expired.

If you're having trouble getting the group id, view the Facebook page source and
look for group_id.  For example, https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheCheltenhamChronicle.org/ has
the group_id=999833573397613.


That's it. You're done the quick run of the prototype.


## Reference:

Here's an example of getting the group id.

# Going Further

If you don't want to run this from a Docker image, you'll need to 
install Pandas. You can look at the requirement.txt file. This is
setup for Python 2.7




## Step 1:  Obtain a Token

   You probably want to use an App toke, since it will stay valid
   for a few months.
   
   https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer
   
   a. Select an App in the drop down box. Or add a new App and select.
   
   b. Select 'Get App Token'
   
     You'll want to paste this token in the file tokenf.py. Or, you 
	 can use my token.


## Step 2:  Get Your GroupID

	a. The groupid goes in tokenf.py
	
	    FACEBOOK_GROUP='25160801076'
