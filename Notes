These are my notes:

Update Dockerfile?

  docker build -t mchirico/facebook-group-scrape:latest .
  docker push mchirico/facebook-group-scrape


Test run

  mkdir -p tmp
  docker run -it -v `pwd`/tmp:/tmp/data mchirico/facebook-group-scrape /bin/sh -c 'cd src && ./mainRun.sh'   


Don't forget to get rid of all your pesky images:

  docker rm $(docker ps -aq)




TODO:

1. Documentation and inprove date rage selection. It's hard
wired into the program.



You had to separate out the two python program because
it releases memory for pandas. Eventually, you'll need to
fix this, and put everything in one python program.

   1. grabFacebookData.py
   2. combineData.py
